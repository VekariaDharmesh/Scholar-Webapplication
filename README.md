## 📌 What is Aura Study?

Aura Study is a professional-grade, AI-powered cognitive study assistant web application designed to act as an intelligent layer over your learning workflow. Blending the high-fidelity aesthetics of Notion AI, the conversational mastery of ChatGPT, and the addictive, gamified motivation loop of Duolingo, Aura Study helps students, self-learners, and developers organize and retain complex information.

It combines the power of local browser execution (for instant, zero-latency interactions) with state-of-the-art AI synthesis to provide:
*   **Spaced Repetition**: Leitner system Box 1-5 schedules for active recall and memory retention.
*   **Real-time speech-to-notes transcription**: Native browser SpeechRecognition Web API.
*   **Procedural audio synthesis**: Custom Web Audio API ambient engines for Rain, Waves, and Binaural Beats.
*   **Gamified metrics cockpit**: Animated streaks, leveling system, XP multipliers, and study leaderboards.

## ✨ Main Features

*   **Smart AI Tutor Workspaces**: Split-pane layout with Socratic, ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5), and Staff Developer personas beside a Notion-styled markdown editor.
*   **Micro-Speech Compiler**: Native Speech-to-Text dictation with a canvas-based WaveformVisualizer to transcribe lectures and instantly generate summary revision sheets.
*   **3D Spaced Flashcards**: Interactive 3D flip-cards utilizing the Leitner spaced-repetition box intervals to optimize your cognitive forgetting curve.
*   **Active MCQ Quiz Arena**: Gamified multiple-choice quizzes with visual XP gains, streak multipliers, and detailed socratic explanations.
*   **Weekly Analytics Diagnostics**: Recharts-powered focus distribution metrics, XP progress lines, and AI-driven weak-topic diagnostics recommending corrective actions.
*   **Theme Color Selector**: A dark-first glassmorphic UI offering custom-tailored color aesthetics (Midnight, Emerald, Cyberpunk, and Rose Gold).

## 🛠️ Full Setup Guide Requirements

*   Node.js 18.x or 20.x
*   Modern Web Browser (Google Chrome / Apple Safari recommended for Web Speech APIs)
*   OpenAI API Key (Optional, for advanced cloud AI tutoring. Standard models run on built-in adaptive simulators fallback!)

### Optional Database Setup
Aura Study operates out of the box with zero setup using browser storage. To scale the workspace to a SQL database:
1. Initialize Prisma client: `npx prisma db push`
2. Connect your PostgreSQL/MySQL endpoint in `.env`.

## 🎵 Ambient Focus Soundscapes

Aura Study features procedural audio generators inside the Pomodoro widget to maximize focus without loading external media:
*   🌧️ **Rain Hum**: Low-pass filtered noise simulating static raindrops.
*   🌊 **Ocean Waves**: Dual slow-frequency modulators replicating low-frequency tides.
*   🎧 **Binaural Alpha Beats**: Dual detuned sine wave oscillators (10Hz split) to induce alpha-wave deep focus.

---

## ⚠️ Notes & Limitations

*   **SpeechRecognition Permissions**: Ensure your browser has active microphone privileges inside the `upload/` dictation page.
*   **API Keys**: Adding a custom API key in `/settings` elevates AI responses using real cloud OpenAI models. Otherwise, standard mock tutoring engines will simulate answers offline.
*   **Offline States**: Resetting all data inside `/settings` clears local browser stores and resets metrics.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

*   **Mobile Companion Apps**: Dedicated iOS and Android native study widgets.
*   **Real PDF Text Extraction**: Expanding simulated OCR dropzones using real PDF.js parse grids.
*   **Collaborative Leaderboards**: Real-time multiplayer quiz challenges using WebSockets.
*   **Advanced LaTeX Rendering**: Real-time rendering of complex mathematical notations inside the markdown editor.
